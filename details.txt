4.2. Streaming responses (file download, large payloads)
4.3. Background tasks and event hooks
4.4. Exception handlers and global error formatting

Security & Authentication
5.1. JWT tokens: generation, validation, and rotation
5.2. OAuth2 Password Flow and scopes
5.3. API key / header-based auth
5.4. Role-based access control (RBAC)
5.5. Secure password hashing and user management

Complex Scenario Patterns
6.1. GraphQL vs. REST integrations
6.2. Multi-step workflows (stateful operations)
6.3. Conditional routing and feature flags
6.4. Versioning strategies and deprecation

Performance & Quality
7.1. Asynchronous endpoints and concurrency

8.6. Zero-downtime deploys (Blue/Green or Canary)

Monitoring & Observability
9.1. Structured logging and correlation IDs
9.2. Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
9.3. Metrics collection (Prometheus / Grafana)
9.4. Alerting on error rates and latency

AI-Augmented Development
